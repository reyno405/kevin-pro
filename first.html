            <p>Hi my name is Kevin! I am 28 years old and from Detroit, Michigan. Currently, I am an Airbnb entrepreneur and run two units in Houston, Texas. In my free time I love to travel and my favorite place to be is on a cruise ship! I am excited to start my new path in computer science. I have high interest in how computers and websites work and how I can learn to code a website. My all time goal is to gain the tools I need to get a job.</p>

            <p>I am outgoing, dedicated, and open-minded. I get across to people and adjust to changes with ease. I believe that a person should work on developing their professional skills and learning new things all the time. Currently, I am looking for new career opportunities my current job position cannot provide.</p>
